  <h1>SLF4J Mailing Lists</h1>

  <p>A mailing list is an electronic discussion forum that anyone can
  subscribe to. When someone sends an email message to the mailing
  list, a copy of that message is broadcast to everyone who is
  subscribed to that mailing list. Mailing lists provide a simple and
  effective communication mechanism. With potentially thousands of
  subscribers, there is a common set of etiquette guidelines that you
  should observe. Please keep on reading.
  </p>

  <h3>Respect the mailing list type</h3>

  <p>The "User" lists where you can send questions and comments about
  configuration, setup, usage and other "user" types of questions.
  The "Developer" lists where you can send questions and comments
  about the actual software source code and general "development"
  types of questions.
  </p>

  <p>Some questions are appropriate for posting on both the "user" and
  the "developer" lists. In this case, pick one and only one. Do not
  cross post.
  </p>
  
  <p>Please do your best to ensure that you are not sending HTML or
  "Stylized" email to the list. If you are using Outlook or Outlook
  Express or Eudora, chances are that you are sending HTML email by
  default. There is usually a setting that will allow you to send
  "Plain Text" email.
  </p>


   <p><span class="label notice">Note</span> <b>Only subscribers can
       post to the slf4j-user and slf4j-dev mailing lists.</b> If you
       are subscribed and your posts bounce, make sure that the
       address you post from matches your subscription address.</p>

   <p><span class="label notice">Note</span> If you are subscribing
    with a <b>Yahoo</b> email address, please make sure to "Star" at
    least several messages sent from our lists. Otherwise, our
    messages are likely to bounce.
